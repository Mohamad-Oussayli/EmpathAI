Emotional Labeling Technique

Naming your emotions helps regulate them.

Steps:
1. Pause when you feel intense emotion.
2. Try to put it into words: “I feel angry,” “I feel overwhelmed,” “I feel hurt.”
3. Don’t analyze — just name it.

Research shows that labeling emotions reduces their intensity and gives you more control.
