1. **Situation**: Describe the event that triggered your emotions.
2. **Emotion**: What did you feel? Rate intensity (0–100).
3. **Automatic Thought**: What crossed your mind?
4. **Cognitive Distortion**: Is this thought distorted? (e.g., overgeneralization, catastrophizing)
5. **Evidence For/Against**: What supports or contradicts it?
