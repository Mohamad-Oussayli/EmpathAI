Values Clarification Exercise

Knowing what matters to you helps align your actions with meaning.

Steps:
1. Identify your core values (e.g., honesty, compassion, creativity).
2. Ask: Are my actions supporting these values?
3. Reflect: What’s one small step I can take today to live one of these values?

When life feels chaotic, values can ground and guide you.
