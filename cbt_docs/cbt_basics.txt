CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) Basics

CBT is based on the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected.
Negative thoughts can lead to negative emotions and behaviors.

Key techniques:
- Identifying cognitive distortions (e.g., black-and-white thinking)
- Reframing negative thoughts
- Practicing behavioral activation
- Using thought records to analyze automatic thoughts

CBT is goal-oriented and structured, often used for anxiety and depression.
