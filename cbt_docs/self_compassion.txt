Self-Compassion Practice

When you're feeling critical of yourself, try this 3-step process:

1. **Mindfulness** – Acknowledge your pain or struggle without exaggerating or suppressing it.  
   e.g., “This is really hard right now.”

2. **Common Humanity** – Recognize that suffering is a shared human experience.  
   e.g., “Others feel this way too — I’m not alone.”

3. **Self-Kindness** – Talk to yourself the way you would to a close friend.  
   e.g., “I’m doing the best I can.”

This practice reduces shame and builds resilience.
