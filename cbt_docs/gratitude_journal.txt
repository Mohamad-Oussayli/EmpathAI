Gratitude Journaling Exercise

Writing down what you’re thankful for can improve mental well-being.

How to do it:
- Every day, write 3 things you’re grateful for.
- Be specific: “My friend called me when I felt down,” not just “Friends.”
- Reflect on why each thing matters to you.

Optional prompt: “What made me smile today?”

Gratitude boosts optimism and reduces negative thinking patterns.
