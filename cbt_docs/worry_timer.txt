Worry Timer Technique

Instead of suppressing anxious thoughts, contain them.

How to apply:
1. Choose a “worry time” — e.g., 6:30–6:45 PM daily.
2. When anxious thoughts arise outside that time, say:  
   “I’ll think about this during my worry time.”
3. When worry time comes, set a timer and allow yourself to focus on those thoughts — then stop.

This creates mental boundaries and reduces rumination.
